        At Obama Elementary, we strive to be a place where every child is supported in their learning and where every
        child is treated with respect and care. In order to provide the best possible education, our community comes
        together to provide students with skills to become lifelong learners through a well balanced curriculum. We will
        continue to create an environment and culture that is both student-centered and solution based.
